## Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

# Description

This website is a weather dashboard.  It uses data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather for cities.  The user will notice that a city can be entered into the search bar and the city's weather will appear.  A five day forcast is also displayed towards the bottom.  After making a few searches, the user will notice that they can click on their previous searches to recall that city's weather forecast.
